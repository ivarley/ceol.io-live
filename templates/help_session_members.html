<h1>Session Members</h1>

<p>The <strong>Members</strong> tab helps you track who plays at your session and manage their attendance.</p>

<h2>Types of Members</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Regulars</strong> - People who attend frequently and are considered part of the session's core group</li>
    <li><strong>Attendees</strong> - Anyone who has played at the session</li>
    <li><strong>Session Admins</strong> - People who can edit the session's details and logs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tracking Attendance</h2>

<p>For each session instance, you can track who attended:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Yes</strong> - Confirmed attendance</li>
    <li><strong>Maybe</strong> - Uncertain</li>
    <li><strong>No</strong> - Not attending</li>
</ul>

<p>Regulars are automatically shown in the attendance list for each session instance.</p>

<h2>Adding People</h2>

<p>Session admins can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Search for existing users to add to the session</li>
    <li>Create new person records for people not yet in the system</li>
    <li>Set someone as a regular member</li>
    <li>Grant session admin privileges</li>
</ul>

<h2>Member Information</h2>

<p>Each member's profile can include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Instruments they play</li>
    <li>Email address (for notifications)</li>
    <li>Attendance history</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check-In Feature</h2>

<p>When a session is active (during its scheduled time), members can check in to show they're attending. This updates the "On Now" indicator and lets others know who's at the session.</p>

<h2>Who Started What</h2>

<p>When logging tunes, session admins can optionally note who started each set. This helps track who introduces which tunes to the session.</p>
