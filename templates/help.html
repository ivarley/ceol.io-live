<h1>What's ceol.io?</h1>

<p>This site allows you to track a list of traditional Irish tunes you know and play.</p>

<p>Its main function is to be your <strong>personal tune list</strong>. You can add tunes you want to learn, or already know, and sync your Tunebook from <a href="https://thesession.org">TheSession.org</a>. You can then sort them so you're learning the right tunes first: the tunes people really play in your sessions.</p>

<p>The site also tracks basic info about sessions, like the address and the recurrence, i.e. how often it happens (like "Every Thursday"). Sessions can be linked to a session record on TheSession.org, and we can import the details from there.</p>

<p>Each time you hold a session, you can <strong>log</strong> the tunes you played on this site. Logs have a date, a list of tunes, and a little other info.</p>

<p>To add a session log, click on "Add" on the Session details page, and it'll ask for the date (defaulting to the next scheduled one based on your session recurrence).</p>

<p>You can then add tunes by typing or pasting the tune names into the text box on the page. It'll automatically link any tunes it can; right click any tune names to see your options on editing, relinking, moving, etc.</p>

<p>You can think of this site as a sort of companion to <a href="https://thesession.org">TheSession.org</a>. Info about tunes and sessions all over the world is there. This site adds the social component of tracking what tunes are really played where.</p>

<p>If you'd like to add your session to our list, <a href="/add-session">feel free!</a></p>
