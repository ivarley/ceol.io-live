## Key Validations

### 1. Complete User Journey
Validated end-to-end workflow:
1. User adds tune to collection
2. Hears tune at sessions (increments count 3 times)
3. Starts actively learning (status → "learning")
4. Marks as learned (status → "learned", learned_date set)
5. Heard count preserved throughout

### 2. Security Validation
- All endpoints require authentication
- Users cannot access other users' data
- Admins have appropriate elevated access
- Proper HTTP status codes (401, 403, 404)

### 3. Data Integrity
- Database constraints enforced
- Foreign key relationships maintained
- Check constraints validated
- Unique constraints prevent duplicates

### 4. API Behavior
- Proper error handling and messages
- Correct HTTP status codes
- JSON response format consistency
- Pagination support

### 5. Mobile Optimization
- Responsive design verified
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Real-time filtering
