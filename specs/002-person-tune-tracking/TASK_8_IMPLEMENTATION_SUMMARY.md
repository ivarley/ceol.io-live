# Task 8 Implementation Summary: Tune Detail View and Status Management

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive tune detail modal view that allows users to view detailed information about tunes in their collection and manage learning status directly from the detail view.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend API Endpoint
**File:** `api_person_tune_routes.py`

Created new endpoint `GET /api/my-tunes/<person_tune_id>` that:
- Returns detailed tune information including:
  - Tune metadata (name, type, key, tunebook count)
  - Learning status and progress
  - Heard before learning count
  - Notes
  - TheSession.org URL
  - Session play count (number of sessions where user is a member and tune has been played)
- Enforces authentication and ownership validation
- Includes authorization check (users can only view their own tunes unless they're admins)

**Route Registration:** Added to `app.py`

### 2. Frontend Modal Implementation
**File:** `templates/my_tunes.html`

#### Modal Structure
- Created responsive modal overlay with clean, accessible design
- Modal displays comprehensive tune information in organized sections:
  - **Tune Information**: Type, key, popularity metrics
  - **Learning Progress**: Status selector, heard count, learned date
  - **Notes**: User's personal notes about the tune
  - **Actions**: Link to TheSession.org, close button

#### JavaScript Functions
- `showTuneDetail(personTuneId)`: Fetches tune details and displays modal
- `displayTuneDetailModal(tune)`: Builds and renders modal content dynamically
- `closeTuneDetailModal()`: Closes the modal
- `updateStatusFromModal(personTuneId)`: Updates learning status from dropdown
- `incrementHeardCountFromModal(personTuneId)`: Increments heard count with + button
- Modal closes when clicking outside (on overlay)

#### Features
- **Dynamic Status Updates**: Dropdown selector for changing learning status
- **Heard Count Management**: Shows heard count with increment button (only for "want to learn" status)
- **Learned Date Display**: Shows when tune was marked as learned
- **Session Play Count**: Displays how many of user's sessions have played this tune
- **TheSession.org Integration**: Direct link to tune page
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes immediately reflected in tune list

### 3. Styling
**File:** `templates/my_tunes.html` (CSS section)

- Modal overlay with semi-transparent backdrop
- Responsive modal dialog (90% width on mobile, max 600px on desktop)
- Clean, organized layout with sections
- Detail rows with labels and values
- Mobile-optimized layout (stacks vertically on small screens)
- Touch-friendly buttons (44px minimum on mobile)
- Dark mode support

### 4. Testing

#### Integration Tests
**File:** `tests/integration/test_person_tune_api.py`

Added 5 new tests:
1. `test_get_person_tune_detail_requires_authentication`: Verifies authentication requirement
2. `test_get_person_tune_detail_success`: Tests successful detail retrieval
3. `test_get_person_tune_detail_not_found`: Tests 404 for non-existent tune
4. `test_get_person_tune_detail_unauthorized`: Tests 403 for unauthorized access
5. `test_get_person_tune_detail_with_session_play_count`: Verifies session play count calculation

#### Functional Test
**File:** `tests/functional/test_personal_tune_management.py`

Added `test_tune_detail_view_workflow`: End-to-end test covering:
- Viewing tune detail
- Updating status from detail view
- Incrementing heard count from detail view
- Verifying all data fields are present and correct

All tests pass successfully.

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 1.5
✅ WHEN a user views a tune's detail page, THEN the system SHALL display the current learn_status

### Requirement 1.6
✅ WHEN a user selects a different learn_status for a tune THEN the system SHALL update the person_tune record immediately

### Requirement 1.7
✅ WHEN a tune has "want to learn" status THEN the system SHALL display a "+" button to increment the heard_before_learning_count

### Requirement 1.8
✅ WHEN a user clicks the "+" button THEN the system SHALL increment the heard_before_learning_count by 1 and display the updated count

### Requirement 4.1
✅ WHEN a user selects a tune from their list THEN the system SHALL display the common tune details page including name, type, key, popularity (tunebook count) on thesession.org, popularity (count in sessions I'm a member of), a link to the tune's page on thesession.org, and any other available metadata

### Requirement 4.2
✅ WHEN tune details are displayed THEN the system SHALL show the current learn_status with option to change it

### Requirement 4.3
✅ WHEN a user updates learn_status from the detail view THEN the system SHALL save the change and return to the filtered list

### Requirement 4.4
✅ (Implicitly satisfied) The detail view provides comprehensive tune information for informed learning decisions

## User Experience

### Interaction Flow
1. User clicks on any tune card in their collection
2. Modal appears with detailed tune information
3. User can:
   - View all tune metadata and statistics
   - Change learning status via dropdown
   - Increment heard count (if status is "want to learn")
   - Click link to view tune on TheSession.org
   - Close modal to return to tune list
4. Changes are immediately saved and reflected in the tune list

### Mobile Optimization
- Modal is fully responsive
- Touch-friendly buttons (minimum 44px)
- Stacked layout on small screens
- Easy to read and interact with on mobile devices

## Technical Highlights

1. **Authorization**: Proper ownership validation using existing decorator pattern
2. **Session Play Count**: Efficient SQL query to count sessions where user is a member and tune has been played
3. **Real-time Updates**: Changes in modal immediately update the main tune list without page reload
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
5. **Accessibility**: Modal can be closed with click outside, proper semantic HTML
6. **Code Reusability**: Leverages existing API endpoints for status updates and heard count increments

## Files Modified

1. `api_person_tune_routes.py` - Added new endpoint
2. `app.py` - Registered new route and import
3. `templates/my_tunes.html` - Added modal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
4. `tests/integration/test_person_tune_api.py` - Added 5 integration tests
5. `tests/functional/test_personal_tune_management.py` - Added functional test
6. `.kiro/specs/personal-tune-management/tasks.md` - Marked task as complete

## Next Steps

Task 8 is complete. The next tasks in the implementation plan are:
- Task 9: Build manual tune addition interface
- Task 10: Create sync interface and user experience
- Task 11: Extend session context menu for tune addition

## Notes

- The modal pattern follows the existing design used in `session_instance_detail_beta.html`
- All existing tests continue to pass
- The implementation is production-ready and fully tested
- The feature integrates seamlessly with the existing tune management functionality
