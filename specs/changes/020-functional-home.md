# 020 Functional Home

We're going to change the home page. Instead of two big buttons (my tune and my sessions), let's make it useful with 2 sections:

Learn Tunes:
  _ [{4} tunes in progress] _ <- links to learning list, ordered by heard count desc, popularity desc
  - [{270} tunes to learn] <- links to ordered by heard count desc, popularity desc
  - [A|Another] common tune you should learn: {name}
Upcoming sessions:
  - list any you attend that are scheduled this week, link to log if it's been created


Logged out version:

[Log In or Register] button as currently

Text (in bigger font than current): "This app is for traditional Irish music sessions and tunes. Keep track of tunes you know or want to learn, see what's popular in different sessions, and log what you play in your session.<p>If you don't want to create an account, you can still [browse sessions]."
