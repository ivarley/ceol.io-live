### Best Practices Timezone Implementation

**Commits:** 6c6fd66 (2025-08-24)

Let's start using best practices for time zones. All time fields stored in the database should be in utc (including for create/modify timestamps, history tables, etc). Don't worry about adjusting data already in the system. Anywhere in the UI that shows a time should show the time zone next to it explicitly.

I want the time zone implementation to be as standard as possible, so if that means changing the existing code (that stores and displays user time zone) that's fine, I can adjust the data in the table as needed. The system should correctly handle daylight savings time and weird cases like India time (which is off GMT by a fractionaly number of hours). Put as little code into our system for this as possible and rely on standard libraries.

Add a field to the session table that explicitly holds the time zone for the session, which will be used to display any dates associated with that session. Session instance start / end times should be stored in UTC and shown adjusted to the time zone of the session. 

User already has a time zone, but it's just a string; change it to something more universal and standard like the hour offset from GTM. All user-specific dates (such as user last login) should be shown mapped to the time zone of the current logged in user. If a viewer isn't logged in, they see session times adjusted by the time zone of the session.

The implementation includes comprehensive timezone support using Python's built-in `zoneinfo` library for maximum compatibility. All database timestamps are stored as `TIMESTAMPTZ` in UTC, with proper timezone conversion for display. The system supports IANA timezone identifiers (e.g., 'America/New_York') instead of legacy strings, handles daylight saving time automatically, and gracefully manages fractional UTC offsets like India Standard Time. Template filters provide automatic timezone conversion in the UI, showing explicit timezone abbreviations (EST, PST, UTC+05:30) alongside times. Users see times in their configured timezone when logged in, while anonymous users see times in the session's timezone. The solution minimizes custom code by leveraging standard libraries and follows timezone best practices throughout.
